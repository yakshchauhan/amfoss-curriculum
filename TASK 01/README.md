used git start after cloning the repo and moving into exercises. 
read a README.md and used git verify.
then amde a commit in same way but instead of git push i used git verify.
then i only commited A.txt in next task.
i have to ignore certain files with extension while commiting i added them in .gitignore that repaet the commiting process.
